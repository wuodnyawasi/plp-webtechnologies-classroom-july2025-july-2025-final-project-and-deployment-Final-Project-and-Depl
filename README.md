# Unclatter

**Unclatter** is a front-end web application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of Unclatter is to help users **sell** or **donate** items they no longer use — from old toys and small furniture to broken chairs and other household items. It promotes a cleaner living space and encourages a circular economy by giving used items a second life.
