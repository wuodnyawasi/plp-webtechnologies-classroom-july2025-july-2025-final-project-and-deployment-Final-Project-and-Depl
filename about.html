            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At **Unclatter**, we believe that one person's clutter can be another's treasure. Our mission is simple yet powerful: to create a platform that reduces waste, helps those in need, and gives items a second chance. We provide an easy way for people to declutter their homes while supporting charitable causes and sustainable living.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>We offer a two-pronged approach for your unwanted items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Donate:</strong> You can donate items you no longer need. We'll take care of them and find a deserving recipient—whether it's an orphanage, a children's home, or an elderly care facility. Your generosity directly impacts the lives of others.</li>
                <li><strong>Sell:</strong> If you prefer to sell your items at a "throwaway price," we'll purchase them. We then take on the task of repairing, rebuilding, or refurbishing them to give them new life. We sell these revitalized items, and from the proceeds, we give **10% to children's homes, elderly homes, and other charitable organizations.**</li>
            </ul>
